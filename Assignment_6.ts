// Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters 
// at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. 
// Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
// Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

// Trim the name all whitespaces.
